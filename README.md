# Search App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

***

Simple app for searching data. Now for getting data used service - [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

***


To get started, use the following commands:

- npm run build
- npm run server

The app will be running on localhost (port 3000)

### TODO

- [x] For sending a request will add some library instead load method
- [x] Create a simple server (develop by Node + Express) for working with requests

Server is needed for full stack and usefulness the application. Data can be taken from a third-party service.
