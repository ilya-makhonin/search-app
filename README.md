# Search App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

***

Simple app for searching data. Now for getting data used service - [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

***

### TODO
- [ ] Replace from Bootstrap to Material Design
- [ ] For sending a request will add some library instead load method
- [ ] Create a simple server (develop by Node + Express) for working with requests
- [ ] Questionable use of the database

Server is needed for full stack and usefulness the application. Data can be taken from a third-party service.
